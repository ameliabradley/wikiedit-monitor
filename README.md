wikiedit monitor
==========

Personal wiki monitor app based on wikistream

Installation
------------

These instructions assume you have Ubuntu. If you don't you'll need to figure
out the equivalent instructions. It shouldn't be too complicated. 

First, you need to get Node and dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    npm install

Next you''ll want to use and/or adjust the default configuration:

    cp conf/config.json.example config.json

You may want to adjust the ircNick that is in the example to something unique,
so that you will be able to join the channels without a collision. Also you 
can adjust the wikipedia language channels that are being monitored.

Then, start the webapp;

    node app.js

wait 10-15 seconds for the app to join the irc channels, and then
point your browser at:

    http://localhost:3000/

For production deployments an upstart script and varnish config are included, 
which you should be able to install and use.

    sudo cp conf/wikistream.conf /etc/init/wikistream.conf
    sudo apt-get install varnish
    sudo cp conf/default.vcl /etc/varnish/
    sudo start wikistream
